Title: E mail Regex Tutorial

Description: In this tutorial, we explore an email regex pattern designed to validate email addresses. This pattern ensures that the email address follows a proper format by checking that it includes a valid local part, a proper domain, and a top-level domain with at least two letters. It also allows for an optional second-level domain. The regex pattern supports a variety of email formats, ensuring they are well-structured and conform to common standards for valid email addresses.
